    /// When we expect a number, string, boolean, or array but have a value, wrap it in an assertion.
    /// When we expect a color or formatted string, but have a string or value, wrap it in a coercion.
    /// Otherwise, we do static type-checking.

    /// * The "coalesce" operator, which needs to omit type annotations.
    /// * String-valued properties (e.g. `text-field`), where coercion is more convenient than assertion.
